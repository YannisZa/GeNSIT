# Configuration settings

Configs consist of nine sections: [`inputs`](#inputs-1), [`contingency table`](#contingency-table), [`spatial interaction model`](#spatial-interaction-model), [`harris wilson model`](#harris-wilson-model), [`training`](#training), [`mcmc`](#mcmc), [`experiments`](experiments), and [`outputs`](#outputs).

### Inputs

The number of workers and number of threads per worker is controlled by `n_workers` and `n_threads`, respectively. The directory from which inputs are read is specified by `in_directory`/`dataset`. The random seed generator can be fixed using `seed`.
